# discord_invite (Resource)

Creates and manages a Discord invite for a channel.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    discord = {
      source  = "tfstack/discord"
      version = "~> 0.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "discord" {}

# Create a channel first
resource "discord_channel" "general" {
  name     = "general"
  type     = "text"
  guild_id = "1452601985235816601" # Replace with your guild ID
}

# Create a permanent invite (never expires, unlimited uses)
resource "discord_invite" "permanent" {
  channel_id = discord_channel.general.id
  max_age    = 0 # Never expires
  max_uses   = 0 # Unlimited uses
  temporary  = false
  unique     = false
}

# Create a temporary invite (expires in 7 days, 10 uses max)
resource "discord_invite" "temporary" {
  channel_id = discord_channel.general.id
  max_age    = 604800 # 7 days in seconds
  max_uses   = 10
  temporary  = true
  unique     = false
}

output "permanent_invite_url" {
  value = discord_invite.permanent.url
}

output "temporary_invite_url" {

## Schema

### Required

- `channel_id` (String) The ID of the channel to create an invite for.

### Optional

- `max_age` (Number) Duration (in seconds) after which the invite expires. 0 means the invite never expires. Defaults to 86400 (24 hours).
- `max_uses` (Number) Maximum number of times the invite can be used. 0 means unlimited. Defaults to 0.
- `temporary` (Boolean) Whether the invite grants temporary membership. If true, members will be kicked when they disconnect unless they're assigned a role. Defaults to false.
- `unique` (Boolean) Whether the invite should be unique. If true, Discord will try to reuse a similar invite. Defaults to false.

### Read-Only

- `code` (String) The invite code (unique identifier for the invite).
- `created_at` (String) When the invite was created (ISO 8601 timestamp).
- `expires_at` (String) When the invite expires (ISO 8601 timestamp). Null if max_age is 0.
- `id` (String) The ID of the invite (same as code).
- `url` (String) The full invite URL (https://discord.gg/{code}).
- `uses` (Number) Number of times the invite has been used.
