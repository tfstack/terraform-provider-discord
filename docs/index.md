# discord Provider

The Discord provider allows you to manage Discord servers, channels, roles, members, and other resources using Terraform. Authentication is done via a Discord bot token, which can be provided in the provider configuration block or via the DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN environment variable. To get a bot token, create a bot application in the Discord Developer Portal and copy the token from the Bot section.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    discord = {
      source  = "tfstack/discord"
      version = "~> 0.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "discord" {}

data "discord_servers" "all" {}

output "servers" {

}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `token` (String, Sensitive) Discord bot token for authentication. This token is required to authenticate with the Discord API. You can obtain a bot token from the Discord Developer Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications). Alternatively, you can set the DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN environment variable instead of providing it here. This attribute is sensitive and will not be displayed in logs or output.
